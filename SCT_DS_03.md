# Task 3 â€“ Decision Tree Classifier on Bank Marketing Dataset
## ðŸ“Œ Objective
Build a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on their personal and contact information.
## ðŸ—‚ Dataset Used
**Bank Marketing Dataset**  
- Source: [UCI Repository / Kaggle version](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/janiobachmann/bank-marketing-dataset)  
- File Used: `bank.csv`  
- Target Variable: `deposit` (Yes/No)
## ðŸ§ª Steps Performed
1. **Loaded the dataset**
2. **Encoded categorical variables** using `LabelEncoder`
3. **Split the data** into training and testing sets
4. **Trained** a Decision Tree Classifier
5. **Evaluated** model using:
   - Accuracy Score
   - Classification Report
   - Confusion Matrix
6. **Visualized**:
   - The Decision Tree structure
   - Correlation Heatmap between features
## ðŸ§  Libraries Used
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `sklearn`
## ðŸ“ˆ Output Examples
- Model Accuracy (e.g., 82%)
- Decision tree plot showing splits
- Feature correlation heatmap
- Precision/Recall of predictions
## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Upload `bank.csv` in your Colab or local environment.
2. Run `main.py` file or paste the code into your notebook.
